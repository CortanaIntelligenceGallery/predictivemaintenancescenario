    "When working with data that comes with time-stamps such as telemetry and errors as in this example, splitting of data into training, validation and test sets should be performed carefully to prevent overestimating the performance of the models. In predictive maintenance, the features are usually generated using laging aggregates and consecutive examples that fall into the same time window may have similar feature values in that window. If a random splitting of training and testing is used, it is possible for some portion of these similar examples that are in the same window to be selected for training and the other portion to leak into the testing data. Also, it is possible for training examples to be ahead of time than validation and testing examples when data is randomly split. However, predictive models should be trained on historical data and valiadted and tested on future data. Due to these problems, validation and testing based on random sampling may provide overly optimistic results. Since random sampling is not a viable approach here, cross validation methods that rely on random samples such as k-fold cross validation is not useful either.\n",
    "\n",
    "For predictive maintenance problems, a time-dependent spliting strategy is often a better approach to estimate performance which is done by validating and testing on examples that are later in time than the training examples. For a time-dependent split, a point in time is picked and model is trained on examples up to that point in time, and validated on the examples after that point assuming that the future data after the splitting point is not known. However, this effects the labelling of features falling into the labelling window right before the split as it is assumed that failure information is not known beyond the splitting cut-off. Due to that, those feature records can not be labeled and will not be used. This also prevents the leaking problem at the splitting point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Validation can be performed by picking different split points and examining the performance of the models trained on different time splits. In the following, we use a splitting points to train the model and look at the performances for the other split in the evaluation section."

This causes an imbalance in the label distribution which usually causes poor performance as algorithms tend to classify majority class examples better at the expense of minority class examples as the total misclassification error is much improved when majority class is labeled correctly. This causes low recall rates although accuracy can be high and becomes a larger problem when the cost of false alarms to the business is very high. To help with this problem, sampling techniques such as oversampling of the minority examples are usually used along with more sophisticated techniques which are not covered in this notebook.\n",
